## Limitations

Current limitation of this resource are :

- `import` is not supported.
- only support Console resources for now

## Migrations notes

In future releases, this terraform provider will support more and more typed resources and you might end up migrating a resource from this generic resource to the typed one.

This migration can only be done by destroying previous resource on Conduktor and recreate it after using the new typed resouce.

Because of that you will need to be extra careful of the current state of the resource before doing migrations.
