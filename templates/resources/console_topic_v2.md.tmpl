# {{ .Name }}

Resource for managing Kafka topics.
This resource allows you to create, read, update and delete kafka topics in Conduktor.

> [!NOTE]
> - It is essential to set `lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }` on production instances to prevent accidental topic deletion and data loss.
> - This setting rejects plans that would destroy or recreate the topic, such as attempting to change uneditable attributes.
> - Read more about it in the [Terraform docs](https://www.terraform.io/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle#prevent_destroy).
> - Some providers may set default configs that will appear after the initial apply. In these cases resource definitions may need to be updated e.g. "cleanup.policy" = "delete" after creating a Redpanda topic

> [!WARNING]
> - This resource is officially supported from Conduktor Console `1.30.0` and newer.
> - Usage of this resource with older Console version might result in unexpected behavior.
> - e.g. `sql_storage` has been made available from Conduktor Console `1.30.0`.
