# conduktor_gateway_token_v2

Resource for managing Conduktor Gateway tokens.
This resource allows you to create and update tokens associated with service accounts in Conduktor Gateway.  
After the initial token creation the provider will subsequently verify the validity of the token by checking the expiry time, and if needed, will create a new one on the next apply.

## Example Usage

### Simple token associated to a service account, no virtual cluster named, uses the default virtual cluster named passthrough
```terraform
resource "conduktor_gateway_token_v2" "simple" {
  username         = "user_passthrough"
  lifetime_seconds = 3600
}
```

### Complex token associated to a service account, with a virtual cluster named
```terraform
resource "conduktor_gateway_token_v2" "complex" {
  vcluster         = "vcluster_sa"
  username         = "user10"
  lifetime_seconds = 3600
}
```

### Example usage where the token value is stored as output and in a local file
Token value is stored as output and in a local file
```terraform
output "complex_token" {
  value     = conduktor_gateway_token_v2.complex.token
  sensitive = true
}

resource "local_file" "complex_token" {
  content  = conduktor_gateway_token_v2.complex.token
  filename = "${path.module}/complex_token.txt"
}
```
